## CORS Proxy

Slash Commands GUI relies on a CORS proxy to make requests to the Discord API. This proxy is a simple [cors-anywhere proxy](https://github.com/Androz2091/androz2091-cors-anywhere). It is necessary because the Discord API does not send the CORS header.  
**Important note**: if you want to add an extra security level, you can host your own CORS proxy on your own machine. Press the **Settings** button during 3 seconds, and a new field will appear, allowing you to enter your proxy URL.
